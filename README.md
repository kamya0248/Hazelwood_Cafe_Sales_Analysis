### Power BI Dashboard

In addition to SQL queries and analysis, I created an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to visualize and explore the coffee shop sales data. This dashboard provides a user-friendly interface to deep-dive into the sales performance, enabling a dynamic view of the key metrics. 

**Key Features:**
- **Total Sales Overview:** Displays total sales, quantities sold, and number of transactions across different timeframes.
- **Sales Breakdown by Product Category and Type:** Allows users to filter and view sales data by product categories (e.g., Coffee, Tea, Snacks) and further by product types.
- **Date-Based Analysis:** Users can filter by specific dates, months, or even drill down into daily sales figures to get detailed insights on sales trends over time.
- **Sales by Location:** The dashboard provides insights into how sales are performing at different store locations.
- **Time-Based Analysis:** Analyzes the sales patterns across different hours of the day and days of the week, identifying peak times for customer transactions.
- **Comparison of Weekday vs. Weekend Sales:** Highlights how sales differ between weekdays and weekends.

This dashboard allows for **dynamic filtering and interaction**, meaning that users can click on different elements (like product categories or dates) to adjust the data being displayed, making it a versatile tool for uncovering actionable insights from the sales data.
